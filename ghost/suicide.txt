You know I did it, right? Gave into the big darkness, etc. No More Games. No More Bombs. No More Walking. No More Fun. No More Swimming. 67. That was 17 years past 50. 17 more than I needed or wanted. Boring. I was always bitchy. No Fun – for anybody. 67. I was getting Greedy. Act your old age, I said. Relax, I told myself – This won’t hurt. Why, exactly, would you want to take my advice?
