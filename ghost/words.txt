What of it? I have stolen more quotes and thoughts and purely elegant little starbursts of writing from the Book of Revelation than from anything else in the English Language -- and it is not because I am a biblical scholar, or because of any religious faith, but because I love the wild power of the language and the purity of the madness that governs it and makes it music. I could go on about it for hours, but we're here to talk about you. Tell me why you're here, and do it quickly goddamnit! There's truth we must wrestle from the sordid abyss of your deplorable condition.
